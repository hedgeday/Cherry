User Feedback

It was unclear where user should swipe away notifications

jquery mobile not working well when keyboard is closed 

tap to zoom in should be disabled?

cordova needs to be restarted for everything to work properly

Anish: 
Upload profile picture from gallery
Upload pictures/audio/video from gallery to playground
Indicate somehow that you can swipe

Mishq: 
Chat grid 30/70 (profilepic/text)    	//done 
possibly a brighter red (light cherry?)
Make all buttons,fields more 'square' (jquery theme)
Playground chat buttons: post and cancel next to each other //done
Update profile button possibly smaller
